# Interview Preparation Repository

Welcome to the **Interview Preparation Repository**! This repository is designed to help developers and engineers prepare for coding interviews by solving a variety of algorithm and data structure problems. Each folder in this repository contains solutions and explanations for common technical interview questions, ensuring you're well-prepared for your next interview.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into different topics, with each folder addressing a specific problem or concept. Below is an overview of the structure:

### Data Structures
- **avl_trees**: Implementation and operations for AVL Trees, a self-balancing binary search tree.
- **heap_insert**: Algorithms for inserting elements into a heap.
- **insert_in_sorted_linked_list**: Solutions for inserting nodes into a sorted linked list.
- **linked_list_cycle**: Detection of cycles in a linked list.
- **linked_list_palindrome**: Check if a linked list is a palindrome.

### Algorithms
- **find_the_loop**: Algorithms to find loops in data structures.
- **radix_sort**: Implementation of the radix sort algorithm.
- **sandpiles**: Solution for the sandpile stabilization problem.
- **minimum_operations**: Solutions to find the minimum number of operations to achieve a specific goal.

### Problem-Solving
- **lockboxes**: Solve problems involving unlocking boxes with keys.
- **log_parsing**: Analyze and parse log data efficiently.
- **palindrome_integer**: Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.
- **primegame**: Solve problems related to prime number games.

### String Manipulation
- **regex**: Practice problems involving regular expressions.
- **substring**: Find and manipulate substrings in larger strings.
- **wild_cmp**: Implement wildcard string comparison.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/interview-preparation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to a specific folder to explore problems and solutions.
   ```bash
   cd avl_trees
   ```

3. Run the solutions or test cases using Python 3.9:
   ```bash
   python3 solution.py
   ```

## Features
- Each folder contains:
  - **Problem Statement**: A detailed description of the problem.
  - **Solution**: A Python implementation of the solution.
  - **Test Cases**: Sample test cases to validate the solution.
  - **README.md**: Folder-specific documentation (if applicable).

## Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.9 or higher
- **Dependencies**: Some problems may require additional libraries like `numpy` or `tensorflow`. Please refer to individual problem folders for specific requirements.
